Hi! My name is Alex, when I'm developing games I use the name greeneagles.

If you happen to be a recruiter or hiring person (thanks for visiting, by the way), you should check out Wordwalker, the project I'm most proud of so far. It's a fully playable puzzle game about spelling tricky words using context clues. I developed all of it by myself over the course of 5 months. Check out the readme in that repository for more information (and how to play it!)

Game development is my true passion. As I look for a way to break into the industry, I am always working on at least one idea at a time, hoping to prove to others and myself that this is what I was meant to do.

Here's some other gamedev projects you can check out:
- Island Hopping Simulator: The baseline for a turn-based grand strategy game that would be about attacking or defending an island.
    - I also made this project in GameMaker Studio (written in C).
- Goofy Golf: A school project that I took the lead on.
- "Wacky Games": My next big effort. I'm trying to make a suite of classic computer games with some friends to see if we can work together on more projects in the future.
- Roster Generator (proof of concept)
- 2D top-down Room generator (proof of concept)

And here's some work or school-related projects that might demonstrate my skill in various areas:
- A comprehensive data analysis of 4th Downs in the NFL
- Maps I completed for the EPA
