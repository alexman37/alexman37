Hi! My name is Alex, when I'm developing games I use the name greeneagles.

In a sentence: I'm 24 years old and I've wanted to be a game developer my entire life. [Also here's my resume.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pd8KySJHd6N3YI6C-zRZfvfEqfMvXQbpOgid0jxTDEo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Released Games

Since you're here, you should check out [Wordwalker](https://github.com/alexman37/wordwalker), the project I'm most proud of so far. It's a fully playable, complete puzzle game about spelling tricky words using context clues. I developed all of it by myself over the course of 5 months. I released it on itch and hope to release it to the App Store / Steam in the coming weeks (as of August 2025). Check out the readme in that repository for more information (and how to play it!)

## Interesting Prototypes

Game development is my true passion. As I look for a way to break into the industry, I am always working on at least one idea at a time, hoping to prove to others and myself that this is what I was meant to do.

Here's some other gamedev projects you can check out:
- [Island Hopping Simulator](https://github.com/alexman37/lonely-island): The baseline for a turn-based grand strategy game that would be about attacking or defending an island.
    - I also made this project in GameMaker Studio (written in C).

<img width="905" height="407" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9172bc7-d7f5-4acb-a98e-b51b3e6b6946" />
<img width="904" height="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5667460c-2848-47ad-b109-8e01f3cb1981" />

- ["Wacky Games"](https://github.com/alexman37/wacky-games): My next big effort. I'm trying to make a suite of classic computer games with some friends to see if we can work together on more projects in the future. Please forgive the amateurish look for now!
<img width="1108" height="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a26a7c-f0a5-452b-94e1-acc085c2ae5a" />

- [Goofy Golf](https://github.com/edwarddu2001/CMSC425-Game): A school project that I took the lead on. Basically the whole thing was developed in 3 weeks, and I did much of the underlying backend work. Here's a [writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B0ZsxVJxLbenDOoxv57Z-n9tU2TgOC-PvNkzY5lESOc/edit?tab=t.0) on it. And a screenshot:

I've improved a lot since then, but this at least shows I was able to work on (and lead) a team to finish a pretty decent game in a short window of time.

## Incomplete Prototypes (with interesting ideas)

- [The Right Door](https://github.com/alexman37/the-right-door): This was going to be a story game about a group of random people stuck in a mansion, where the only way out is to follow an ever-expanding complicated set of "house rules". I got as far as a room generation system, a dialogue system, and some sprite art!

- [Haystack](https://github.com/alexman37/HAYSTACK-GAME/tree/main/Assets/Scenario): This was an overly ambitious game about solving a randomly generated murder mystery. I used some cool tricks to develop sprites that generate on the fly, and did a decent (back then it was decent, anyways...) job of organizing the overall project structure. **But as you can see the visual design was very unfinished.** Maybe I'll come back to this someday.

Basic Room generation (w/ chracter sprites generated on the fly):

Roster generation (The list of characters you'd interact with):

## Other
And here's some work or school-related projects that might demonstrate my skill in various areas:
- [A comprehensive data analysis of 4th Downs in the NFL.](https://aack37.github.io/aack37/)
- [Maps I completed for the EPA.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vDQ4hmy-gXlUUO1SJuB9jJpgcCy3GO-X/edit) I like maps. Very much.
