Hi! My name is Alex, when I'm developing games I use the name greeneagles.

If you happen to be a recruiter or hiring person (thanks for visiting, by the way), you should check out [Wordwalker](https://github.com/alexman37/wordwalker), the project I'm most proud of so far. It's a fully playable, complete puzzle game about spelling tricky words using context clues. I developed all of it by myself over the course of 5 months. I released it on itch and hope to release it to the App Store / Steam in the coming weeks (as of August 2025). Check out the readme in that repository for more information (and how to play it!)

Game development is my true passion. As I look for a way to break into the industry, I am always working on at least one idea at a time, hoping to prove to others and myself that this is what I was meant to do.

Here's some other gamedev projects you can check out:
- Island Hopping Simulator: The baseline for a turn-based grand strategy game that would be about attacking or defending an island.
    - I also made this project in GameMaker Studio (written in C).

- Goofy Golf: A school project that I took the lead on.
- "Wacky Games": My next big effort. I'm trying to make a suite of classic computer games with some friends to see if we can work together on more projects in the future.
- Roster Generator (proof of concept)
- 2D top-down Room generator (proof of concept)

And here's some work or school-related projects that might demonstrate my skill in various areas:
- A comprehensive data analysis of 4th Downs in the NFL
- Maps I completed for the EPA
